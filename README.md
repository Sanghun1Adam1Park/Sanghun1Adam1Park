- 👀 I’m interested in Data Science

- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on ...
- 📫 How to reach me ...

Hello, I go by the name of Adam, tho it's not my real real name, it's my english name
I'm currentyly studying TCS at UTwetne, and I'm really intrested in the filed of data science, because I want to work on that field one day.
I just finished the first module of my frist year at Utwente(my study consits of 4 modules each year, and 3 years). 
Before coming to this university, I have tiny bit of experience Pyhton and even tinier bit experience with Java. 
I did not know what to expect from this study(I mean I did but not throughly enough), and I was not even sure if i wanted to study this study because I barely 
knew anything about Computer Science or Programming in general 
So, I did some research, and the Field of Data Science really sounds interesting to me.
This motivated me to start on working on side project besides those that the university requires men to do.
And, to make my own Github page to make use my Github page as refrence to show my progress which I hope that this will help me find a job later on haha.
So, on my github page, I will post my side project or maybe even the ones that univesrity have given me as assignment.
